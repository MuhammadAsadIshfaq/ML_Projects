The history of Punjab, a region in South Asia, is characterized by its ancient civilization, cultural diversity, and historical significance. The name "Punjab" is derived from the Persian words "panj" meaning five and "ab" meaning water, referring to the five rivers that flow through the region â€“ the Beas, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej.

Punjab has a rich history dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world's oldest urban cultures. Over the centuries, the region saw the rise and fall of various empires, including the Maurya and Gupta empires. In medieval times, Punjab became a significant part of the Islamic Caliphate and later the Delhi Sultanate.

The Mughal Empire, under Emperor Akbar, further solidified its influence over Punjab, contributing to the cultural and economic development of the region. However, in the 18th century, the Sikh Empire emerged under leaders like Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who unified the various Sikh factions and established a formidable kingdom that encompassed a significant part of Punjab.

The 19th century brought significant changes with the annexation of Punjab by the British East India Company after the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849. The region played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement, with notable events such as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 leaving a lasting impact on the collective memory.
